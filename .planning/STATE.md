# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Core value:** Complete persistent insurance and servicing journeys with consistent versions, decisions, documents and finance.
**Current focus:** Execute Phase 4 plan 04-07: trusted agency scope, permissions and sharing.

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 13 (Agency onboarding and access)
Plan: 04-07 of 8 in progress; 04-01 through 04-06 complete, all six Phase 3 plans complete
Status: In progress â€” autonomous
Last activity: 2026-09-15 -04-07 own-user service authority now checked before receipt replay;318backend/55SQL and79contracts pass. External login remains closed.

Progress: Phases 1â€“3 complete; 3/13 phases. Agency onboarding/access next.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Both Motor Trade products and Commercial Combined in back office; CC assumptions authorised.
- External services use persistent deterministic demo adapters.
- Sales funnel stays unchanged and serves only as reference.
- Separate broker portal excluded by explicit prototype boundary; internal sharing reference included.
- Focused research completed; see research/SUMMARY.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Pending Todos

- Execute 04-07 through 04-08 sequentially; keep all gates and consume ACCEPTANCE-BACKLOG.md.
- Keep future business endpoints closed until their owning phases implement and verify them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No implementation blocker. Optional Docker runtime remains unverified; native SQL2022 is verified.
- GSD state patch unexpectedly reset milestone metadata during this session. Recovered with state.milestone-switch; verify metadata before future generic state commands.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-15
Stopped at:04-07 own-user service command authority verified. Invite/Edit/Deactivate/Reactivate use mandatory current authority callback before receipts; broker Stage denied; last-admin/session invariants preserved. Full .local/phase4-own-user-full318/55SQL passes (256unit/62integration),79contracts pass. No frontend/schema/identity changes; prior30frontend/build/browser evidence remains. No active tests/previews. NEXT invitation resend/revoke pre-replay authority and scoped own-user/invitation reads, effective server matrix, then external authentication/session/workspace guards and actual accepted-account tests. Read04-07-PROGRESS/04-DATA-API-DESIGN. No wholeAGY/humanUAT acceptance.

## Autonomous continuation

User approved requirements/roadmap and autonomous choices/progression on 2026-09-13. Routine confirmation is no longer required. Keep checks enabled; fix gaps instead of silently deferring them. Mode and auto_advance verified through GSD init.

Thread heartbeat: continue-cover-mga-back-office-mvp, active every 10 minutes. Resume unfinished work in this same task; notify meaningful progress/blockers only; pause on actual milestone completion, user stop or persistent external blocker with no remaining useful work.
