# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Core value:** Complete persistent insurance and servicing journeys with consistent versions, decisions, documents and finance.
**Current focus:** Execute Phase 4 plan 04-06: activation, suspension and agreed terms.

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 13 (Agency onboarding and access)
Plan: 04-06 of 8 in progress; 04-01 through 04-05 complete, all six Phase 3 plans complete
Status: In progress — autonomous
Last activity: 2026-09-14 — 04-06 agency association lock-order fences verified against suspension races through match and public relationship API. Full283/44SQL pass.

Progress: Phases 1–3 complete; 3/13 phases. Agency onboarding/access next.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Both Motor Trade products and Commercial Combined in back office; CC assumptions authorised.
- External services use persistent deterministic demo adapters.
- Sales funnel stays unchanged and serves only as reference.
- Separate broker portal excluded by explicit prototype boundary; internal sharing reference included.
- Focused research completed; see research/SUMMARY.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Pending Todos

- Execute 04-06 through 04-08 sequentially; keep all gates and consume ACCEPTANCE-BACKLOG.md.
- Keep future business endpoints closed until their owning phases implement and verify them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No implementation blocker. Optional Docker runtime remains unverified; native SQL2022 is verified.
- GSD state patch unexpectedly reset milestone metadata during this session. Recovered with state.milestone-switch; verify metadata before future generic state commands.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-14
Stopped at: Client relationship and match mutations now lock Agency before child records and revalidate the planned source under locks. Real SQL tests hold agency UPDLOCK, probe child locks, commit suspension and verify link/separate/public relationship API reject without associations; historical query remains usable. Full283 backend/44SQL and77 contracts plus OpenAPI lint pass. CI minima283/44 Windows and281/42 Linux. No migration, seed or frontend change. Next implement suspension/reactivation proposals and independent decisions with atomic session/stamp/invitation revocation, then scoped API/DI/read/UI wiring and final lifecycle writer races. Activation and terms services already exist internally; no public approval UI or human UAT claimed. Prior22 frontend/build/browser current; no tests/previews active; broker login closed until04-07.

## Autonomous continuation

User approved requirements/roadmap and autonomous choices/progression on 2026-09-13. Routine confirmation is no longer required. Keep checks enabled; fix gaps instead of silently deferring them. Mode and auto_advance verified through GSD init.

Thread heartbeat: continue-cover-mga-back-office-mvp, active every 10 minutes. Resume unfinished work in this same task; notify meaningful progress/blockers only; pause on actual milestone completion, user stop or persistent external blocker with no remaining useful work.
