# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Core value:** Complete persistent insurance and servicing journeys with consistent versions, decisions, documents and finance.
**Current focus:** Execute Phase 4 plan 04-06: activation, suspension and agreed terms.

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 13 (Agency onboarding and access)
Plan: 04-06 of 8 in progress; 04-01 through 04-05 complete, all six Phase 3 plans complete
Status: In progress — autonomous
Last activity: 2026-09-15 — Terms request history/full review/independent decisions wired;29frontend checks/build and three terms browser suites pass.

Progress: Phases 1–3 complete; 3/13 phases. Agency onboarding/access next.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Both Motor Trade products and Commercial Combined in back office; CC assumptions authorised.
- External services use persistent deterministic demo adapters.
- Sales funnel stays unchanged and serves only as reference.
- Separate broker portal excluded by explicit prototype boundary; internal sharing reference included.
- Focused research completed; see research/SUMMARY.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Pending Todos

- Execute 04-06 through 04-08 sequentially; keep all gates and consume ACCEPTANCE-BACKLOG.md.
- Keep future business endpoints closed until their owning phases implement and verify them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No implementation blocker. Optional Docker runtime remains unverified; native SQL2022 is verified.
- GSD state patch unexpectedly reset milestone metadata during this session. Recovered with state.milestone-switch; verify metadata before future generic state commands.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-15
Stopped at: Terms proposal history and independent decision UI implemented. AgencyTermsRequests fresh-reads own request ETag, renders full shared exact snapshot, enforces independent actor UI, reason, immutable uncertain outcome/body/key/ETag retry, stale retention and refreshes after decisions. Proposal success refreshes pending list; approved decision refreshes parent/products/history.29 frontend tests/typecheck/lint/build pass; new review browser test uses two real identities and explicit proposal/decision fixtures; existing terms proposal/display browser regressions pass. No SQL publication claimed by frontend fixtures. Prior289backend/47SQL/78contracts current. NEXT: full real positive activation/terms/suspension/reactivation browser lifecycle against SQL, then remaining races/source/keyboard/mobile acceptance and04-06 summary. UI wiring now complete; do not repeat frontend fixture-only slices. Broker login closed until04-07, no human UAT/phase completion claimed. Owned previews stopped.

## Autonomous continuation

User approved requirements/roadmap and autonomous choices/progression on 2026-09-13. Routine confirmation is no longer required. Keep checks enabled; fix gaps instead of silently deferring them. Mode and auto_advance verified through GSD init.

Thread heartbeat: continue-cover-mga-back-office-mvp, active every 10 minutes. Resume unfinished work in this same task; notify meaningful progress/blockers only; pause on actual milestone completion, user stop or persistent external blocker with no remaining useful work.
