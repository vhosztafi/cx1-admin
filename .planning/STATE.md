# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Core value:** Complete persistent insurance and servicing journeys with consistent versions, decisions, documents and finance.
**Current focus:** Execute05-03 quote creation/business wizard;05-01 and05-02 complete.

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 13 (Motor Trade quote capture)
Plan: 05-03 of11 ready; quote persistence/API and native demo examples verified
Status: In progress — autonomous
Last activity: 2026-09-16 — Completed05-02;476backend/67SQL,291contracts,30frontend;8native demo quotes retained on repeat.

Progress: Phases1–4 complete;4/13phases,26completed plans.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Both Motor Trade products and Commercial Combined in back office; CC assumptions authorised.
- External services use persistent deterministic demo adapters.
- Sales funnel stays unchanged and serves only as reference.
- Separate broker portal excluded by explicit prototype boundary; internal sharing reference included.
- Focused research completed; see research/SUMMARY.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Pending Todos

- Execute05-03 quote creation/business/term wizard; consume05-02-SUMMARY/REVIEW,05-03-PLAN,UI-SPEC,source mappings and ACCEPTANCE-BACKLOG. Retain all runtime gates.
- Keep future business endpoints closed until their owning phases implement and verify them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No implementation blocker. Optional Docker runtime remains unverified; native SQL2022 is verified.
- GSD state patch unexpectedly reset milestone metadata during this session. Recovered with state.milestone-switch; verify metadata before future generic state commands.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-16
Stopped at:05-02 complete and summary committed; native8quote seed/repeat verified. NEXT05-03 creation/business/term wizard with frontend-design/React skills and real browser checks. Read05-02-SUMMARY and05-03-PLAN.
Resume file: .planning/phases/05-motor-trade-quote-capture/05-03-PLAN.md

## Autonomous continuation

User approved requirements/roadmap and autonomous choices/progression on 2026-09-13. Routine confirmation is no longer required. Keep checks enabled; fix gaps instead of silently deferring them. Mode and auto_advance verified through GSD init.

Thread heartbeat: continue-cover-mga-back-office-mvp, active every 10 minutes. Resume unfinished work in this same task; notify meaningful progress/blockers only; pause on actual milestone completion, user stop or persistent external blocker with no remaining useful work.

Latest checkpoint:05-02-SUMMARY records completed persistent quote backend and native examples. Full readiness remains blocked until dependent semantic/evidence/matching checks; no QUO signoff before05-11.
