# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Core value:** Complete persistent insurance and servicing journeys with consistent versions, decisions, documents and finance.
**Current focus:** Execute Phase 4 plan 04-05: agency users and secure invitation lifecycle.

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 13 (Agency onboarding and access)
Plan: 04-05 of 8 in progress; 04-01 through 04-04 complete, all six Phase 3 plans complete
Status: In progress — autonomous
Last activity: 2026-09-14 — 04-05 active invitation commands f86d9d3 and user lifecycle ee5db25 verified;230 backend/31SQL pass. Token acceptance and public user APIs/UI remain.

Progress: Phases 1–3 complete; 3/13 phases. Agency onboarding/access next.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Both Motor Trade products and Commercial Combined in back office; CC assumptions authorised.
- External services use persistent deterministic demo adapters.
- Sales funnel stays unchanged and serves only as reference.
- Separate broker portal excluded by explicit prototype boundary; internal sharing reference included.
- Focused research completed; see research/SUMMARY.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Pending Todos

- Execute 04-05 through 04-08 sequentially; keep all gates and consume ACCEPTANCE-BACKLOG.md.
- Keep future business endpoints closed until their owning phases implement and verify them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No implementation blocker. Optional Docker runtime remains unverified; native SQL2022 is verified.
- GSD state patch unexpectedly reset milestone metadata during this session. Recovered with state.milestone-switch; verify metadata before future generic state commands.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-14
Stopped at: 04-05 user lifecycle committedee5db25 on active invitation commandsf86d9d3. Read04-05-PROGRESS.md. Full230/31SQL and76contracts pass. Continue bounded token acceptance/password hashing/one-time transaction and Development-only audited demo reveal, then public user/invitation APIs/DI and source UI. Current internal services support draft staging, active issuance, resend/revoke, edit/deactivate/reactivate, last-active-admin and atomic stamp/session revocation. Broker auth remains closed until04-07. No tests/previews active; plan and AGY requirements remain incomplete.

## Autonomous continuation

User approved requirements/roadmap and autonomous choices/progression on 2026-09-13. Routine confirmation is no longer required. Keep checks enabled; fix gaps instead of silently deferring them. Mode and auto_advance verified through GSD init.

Thread heartbeat: continue-cover-mga-back-office-mvp, active every 10 minutes. Resume unfinished work in this same task; notify meaningful progress/blockers only; pause on actual milestone completion, user stop or persistent external blocker with no remaining useful work.
