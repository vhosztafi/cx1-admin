# Project State

## Project Reference

See PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md.

**Core value:** Complete persistent insurance and servicing journeys with consistent versions, decisions, documents and finance.
**Current focus:** Execute Phase 4 plan 04-06: activation, suspension and agreed terms.

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 13 (Agency onboarding and access)
Plan: 04-06 of 8 in progress; 04-01 through 04-05 complete, all six Phase 3 plans complete
Status: In progress — autonomous
Last activity: 2026-09-14 — 04-06 subsequent terms proposal/decision transactions verified with independent-review race, rollback and replay. Full277/38SQL pass. State activation and public wiring next.

Progress: Phases 1–3 complete; 3/13 phases. Agency onboarding/access next.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Both Motor Trade products and Commercial Combined in back office; CC assumptions authorised.
- External services use persistent deterministic demo adapters.
- Sales funnel stays unchanged and serves only as reference.
- Separate broker portal excluded by explicit prototype boundary; internal sharing reference included.
- Focused research completed; see research/SUMMARY.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Pending Todos

- Execute 04-06 through 04-08 sequentially; keep all gates and consume ACCEPTANCE-BACKLOG.md.
- Keep future business endpoints closed until their owning phases implement and verify them.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No implementation blocker. Optional Docker runtime remains unverified; native SQL2022 is verified.
- GSD state patch unexpectedly reset milestone metadata during this session. Recovered with state.milestone-switch; verify metadata before future generic state commands.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-09-14
Stopped at: AgencyTermsService now proposes and independently applies/rejects subsequent terms atomically with immutable products, audit, receipt and agency ETag. Locks current identity/roles, distribution range and product/provider prerequisites. Real SQL verifies reviewer race, injected rollback, stale base/rule, rejection and authorized replay after date passage. Full277 backend/38SQL and77 contracts pass; prior22frontend/build/browser current. Read04-06-PROGRESS.md. Next activation/state service with current evidence + initial extraction, issuance/notifications/follow-ups; suspension and Phase3 lock fences; then register/wire scoped APIs/UI and configuration/role writer race acceptance. TermsService is not publicly exposed yet. Broker login closed until04-07. No tests/previews active.

## Autonomous continuation

User approved requirements/roadmap and autonomous choices/progression on 2026-09-13. Routine confirmation is no longer required. Keep checks enabled; fix gaps instead of silently deferring them. Mode and auto_advance verified through GSD init.

Thread heartbeat: continue-cover-mga-back-office-mvp, active every 10 minutes. Resume unfinished work in this same task; notify meaningful progress/blockers only; pause on actual milestone completion, user stop or persistent external blocker with no remaining useful work.
